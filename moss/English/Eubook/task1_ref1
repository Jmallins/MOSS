European proposals for civil society.
Presidential Presentation
The European Economic and Social Committee adopted a document on the proposals for a civil society.
This programme allows the Committee to take a position on two major issues: the need for economic and social recovery on the one hand, and the EU elections.
Through this programme, the Committee calls on European institutions, the Member States, and on the citizens of the EU, to ensure that the elections are about European issues and not only about matters of national interest.
This is especially important now, when all European countries are engaging in debate on economic and ficial recovery.
This debate requires EU responses and common decisions
Through A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society, the Committee presents the institutions with measures and actions which Europe must undertake in order to support a sustainable economic and social recovery.
The goal is to support the consolidation of integration.
These needs include and understanding of the meaning of the European project, which goes beyond the confines of the market and institutions, and encourages the qualitative development of our society.
Mario Sepi, President of the EESCBrussels, 24 March 2009
A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society has three objectives: prospective, political, and institutional. The prospective objective reveals the Committee's soul in a global framework that reflects on its consistency.
This programme permits the Committee's members, who represent EU civil society organizations, to give their views on the choices Europe must make for a sustainable future in a crisis world. The Committee's political objective is to present a civil society manifesto to the other institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council in particular, in order to support their actions on achieving Europe's shared goals.
The European Economic and Social Committee proposes measures to deal with European challenges.
These three objectives are interlinked by an important central idea that constitutes the Committee's very essence: the development of an inclusive and mutually supportive EU model, which must lead to better coordination between economic and political rules.
The ficial crisis spread internationally has presented new challenges.
poverty; social balances, business innovations, natural resources, energy, and migration. In this context, civil society and citizens expect concrete answers from the European institutions, which are responsible for developing decisive policies for Europe's future.
The EU aims to become a global pioneer in developing a long-term model.
The European Economic and Social Committee calls on the institutions to provide responses enabling Europe to fully play this role.
It is important that society be heard.
