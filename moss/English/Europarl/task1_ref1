finest achievements of human history
If anyone, in any country or continent, doubts how the human will and the courage of representatives with a mission can build a new future from decades of despair, reflect on how, 60 years ago, Europeans spoke of enmity Which were always ingrained and relationships that could never be repaired.
They talked, Cold War
far less that it could unite and cooperate.
none but those on the political extremes would question that we are stronger together
Something that surely for each of us in this Chamber must count as one of the most defining events of our lives - the fall of the Berlin Wall.
President of the European Parliament's inaugural address
Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
I am the thirteenth President of the European Parliament.
I am pleased to see former Presidents among us.
Your presence is a privilege.
My election is symbolic of the now fulfilled dream of a united continent held by European citizens.
My dear colleagues, I know and understand the concerns, needs and expectations of those who recently joined the Union.
I know, because in my country they're the same.
We share a responsibility for the future of our continent.
The old and new Europe are no more.
This is our Europe!
it should be modern  and strong.
We want our citizens to see it as such.
calling for energy and hard work.
It's a goal that generations of Europeans have dreamed of and one worthy of the effort needed to achieve it.
I am ready to make the effort
As we begin this new parliamentary term, we face many challenges.
We must meet those challenges.
We must remember that the European Parliament plays a special role that is institutional and social, a deeply symbolic role.
The European Parliament makes up the European democratic system.
The next item is the debate on motions for Guinea's resolution
Mr. President, I believe that the the interest in this matter outweigh the crowd that have came into this Chamber, which I regret for my group and others.
They need international support, Mr President.
Since the death of President Cont√©, a military junta seized power.
It promised to transform to a civil regime hence the domestic support although criticised by international community
Junta Captain Dadis Camara committed not to stand in the presidential elections until disastrous management of the country - no budget, no public tender bids, no basic services for the people - he got a taste for power and clung to it, making him stand in the elections.
His electoral campaign relies on the country's resources.
This violation of former junta commitments made the opposition organise a demonstration which was brutally repressed by the presidential guard.
It left 150 dead, more than 1000 injured, and many women raped and disembowelled.
The reaction of the European Parliament, and hopefully, the European Union, will be clear
We request  suspension of the European Union fisheries agreement.
We want the African Union to impose sanctions on the military junta, and organise a dialogue within a reconciliation committee.
We're calling for the installation of a transitional government in preparation for the presidential and legislative elections.
I hope that these reactions will set a precedent,  so that in cases of breaches of human rights, the European Union will act just as promptly.
author. - Mr. President, when looking into the situation of Guinea and learning about the atrocities in recent months, the first legitimate question is why it has had so little media coverage.
There have only been a few lines, as though there had not been hundreds of people killed and terrible acts of torture and rape aimed at annihilating human dignity.
Various international institutions have condemned the military junta, but much more should have been done to raise awareness among ordinary citizens, including European citizens.
This is why I am pleased that the European Parliament has an appropriate reaction, and the resolution we will vote on today will address it.
Of utmost importance is not only to criticise and condemn the current regime but eliminate any possibility of European funds intended to help the people of Guinea being misappropriated.
28 September is important for the people of Guinea it is the day when the referendum on independence took place.
