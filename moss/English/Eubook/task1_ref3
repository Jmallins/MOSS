For the first time in its history, the EU Economic and Social Committee is to adopt a comprehensive, detailed and timely document on the ongoing political debate and the urgent and concrete problems facing Europe- A programme for EU: proposals of civil society
The programme enables the Committee to focus on economic and social recovery and the European elections.
The programme calls on the Committee. to ensure that the European elections are about European issues to ensure that the European elections are about European issues.
This is especially important at this time, when all EU countries are engaged in the debate on economic and ficial recover
The debate requires European responses and common decisions.
Through A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society, measures for economic recovery are presented.
The Committee has set itself the goal of supporting the consolidation of EU integration, our democracies as well as our responses to public needs.
These needs include an understanding of the very meaning of the EU project: a meaning that goes beyond the confines of the market and the institutions and encourages the qualitative development of society.
Mario Sepi, President of EESC Brussels, 24 March 2009
A Programme for Europe has a prospective objective, a political objective and an institutional objective.
This European programme creates a sustainable future and attempts to achieve Europe's shared goals.
Finally, the institutional objective is to place the ideas of the European Economic and Social Committee at the center of debate on European challenges in the near future by proposing concrete measures.
The three objectives are interlinked to support the European model and integration strategies.
The crisis started in the ficial system, has spread to the international economic system , and has presented us with new questions while aggravating existing challenges, namely :
Poverty; social balances, the vitality and innovation of our businesses, natural resources, energy sources, and migration require solutions from European institutions.
The EU aims to be a global pioneer in its defence of a long-term development model.
The EU Economic and Social Committee calls on the institutions to give strong responses that'll enable EU to play this role
As we approach the renewal of the European institutions responsible for taking the necessary actions, it is important for civil society, made up of driving forces in direct contact with our social and economic realities, to be heard.
