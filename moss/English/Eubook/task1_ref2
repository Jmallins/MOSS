A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society
President's presentation
The European Economic and Social Committee  is adopting a comprehensive and timely document of the ongoing political debate and the problems facing Europe for the first time - A programme for Europe : proposals of civil society.
This programme allows the Committee to take a position on two major issues: economic and social recovery, and the European elections.
Through this programme, the Committee call on European institutions, the Member states, political and social powers, and the citizens of the European Union to ensure that the elections are about European issues and not just matters of national interest.
This is especially important at this time, when all Europeans are engaged in the debate on economic recovery.
The debate requires responses and decisions.
Through A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society, the Committee presents a set of measures and actions that Europe must undertake to support progress-oriented and sustainable economic and social recovery.
The Committee supports European integration.
These needs include an understanding of what the European project means: a meaning that goes beyond markets and institutions, and encourages the development of our society.
Mario Sepi, President of the EESCBrussels
A Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society has three fundamental objectives: prospective, political, and institutional.  The prospective objective reveals the Committee's soul in a global framework the reflects their consistency.
This programme permits the Committee's members to set out their views on the choices that Europe must make for a sustainable future in a world in crisis.  The committee's political objective is to present what might be termed a civil society manifesto to the other institutions, European Parliament, and the Commission and Counsel to support their actions.
Finally, the institutional objective to to place the ideas of the Committee at the heart of the debate on the challenges facing Europe in the coming years by proposing concrete measures.
These three objectives are interlinked by a central idea that conveys the essence of the Committee: developing an inclusive and symbiotic European model, leading to stronger coordination between economic and political rules based on cooperation and integration strategies.
The crisis, originating in the ficial system and spreading worldwide, has presented our societies with new questions and aggravated existing challenges, such as
poverty, social balances, business vitality and innovation, natural resources, energy sources, and migration.  Civil society and citizens expect concrete answers during this time of unprecedented change.
The EU aims to be a global pioneer.
The European Economic and Social Committee calls on the institutions to enable Europe to play this role.
As we approach the renewal of the European institutions responsible to taking the necessary actions, it is important for civil society to be heard.
