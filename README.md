Evaulation Data used within "[Sentence Compression for Arbitrary Languages via Multilingual Pivoting](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1267)".



## Data set 
MOSS is a parallel corpus containing documents
from the European parliament proceedings,
TED talks, news commentaries, and the EU
bookshop. Each document is written in English,
French, and German, and compressed by native
speakers of the respective language who process
a document at a time. We obtain five compressions
per document.
